HealthEase
Project Overview
HealthEase is an AI-powered web application designed to provide an end-to-end solution for symptom-based disease detection and medicine procurement. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the platform delivers fast, accurate disease diagnosis based on user-input symptoms, and seamlessly integrates an e-commerce system for purchasing recommended medicines. This unified approach enhances healthcare accessibility and user convenience.

Key Features
Symptom-Based Disease Prediction: Utilizes a robust Random Forest classifier achieving 89% accuracy to provide reliable disease diagnosis.
Personalized Medicine Recommendations: Suggests appropriate medications and self-care advice based on predicted conditions.
Integrated E-Commerce Platform: Enables users to browse, order, and purchase medicines securely within the same system.
User Authentication & Management: Supports secure user registration, login, and profile management.
Administrator Dashboard: Facilitates effective management of medicines, users, and orders through a comprehensive admin interface.
Responsive and Intuitive UI: Designed for ease of use, enhanced with real-time predictions and symptom suggestions to improve data entry accuracy.
Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Backend: Python Flask Framework
Database: MySQL
Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Random Forest, SVC, Gradient Boosting, KNN, MultinomialNB)
Development Tools: PyCharm, Google Colab
